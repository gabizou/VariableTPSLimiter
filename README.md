# VariableTPSLimiter

# My Recomendation
I recomend that nobody uses this plugin yet because it is still a work in progress and there are still some minor issues with clients crashing / being disconected.
# Still in Alpha
This plugin is still in alpha stages and is still missing some major fetures. Eventually there will be a command that lets you choose between 20 (standard) / 40 / 80 / 200 / inf tps, ofc it will only go as fast as your server pc can handle so if you have a bad server, even if you set it to 200 tps, it may not hit tps. Currently it just runs as fast as possible.
# What this plugin is designed for
This plugin is designed for minecraft players who are into making redstone computers / cpus. By speeding up the tickrate you can make the redstone circuts run faster than normal. If you are interested in seeing a server with the plugin running the plugin DM "Pink Fluffy Llama#3118" on discord and they will be happy to show you arround!
# What type of plugin is this?
This is a plugin designed for and tested on Vanilla Sponge 1.12.2. Its **should** work on Forge vanilla but I havent tested it on there.
